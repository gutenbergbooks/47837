Courteous Reader, this
ensuing Treatise hath
lien by mee a long time,
penned, but in a confused
and undigested manner,
as I gathered it, practised, or found
it out by industry and experience. It
was not in my minde to have as yet exposed
it to the publique view: but being
sollicited by the intreaties of some, and
those not a few, to impart to each particular
person what his <i>Genius</i> most affected;
I was enforced as well for the satisfying
of their requests, as for the avoydance
of many inconveniences, to
dispose in some order such Experiments
as for the present I was content to impart.
Expect no elegancy of phrase, for
my time would not afford that, (nor
indeed my selfe to be the transcriber.)
I endeavored as much as I could, to
write in plaine termes, that in regard of
the easinesse thereof it might suit with
the meanest capacity. The whole book
consisteth of foure parts: The first
whereof treateth of Water-workes.
The second of Fire-workes. The third
of Drawing, Painting, Graving, and
Etching. The fourth and last part treateth
of severall Experiments, as well serviceable
as delightfull: which because
they are confusedly intermixed, I have
entituled them <i>Extravagants</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now my chiefest ayme and end being
the generall good, I could wish a generall
acceptance, but that is too uncertaine
to expect: I will content my selfe
that I am already certaine that these my
first and weak endeavours will finde acceptance
with some, and I hope also
with all honest and indifferent Readers;
as for others, hap as hap may be, it is
not to be doubted, but that I shall scape
as well as many my betters have done
before me. Farewell.</p>

It hath been an old saying amongst
Philosophers, and experience doth
prove it to be true, <i>Non datur vacuum</i>,
that is to say, Nature will not
admit of any vacuity, or emptinesse. For some
one or other of the Elements, but especially
Ayre, and Water doe insert themselves into all
manner of concavities, or hollownesses, in, or
upon the earth, whether they are such as are
formed either by Art or Nature. For the one it
is so obvious, and manifest, as that it needs not
any proofe at all. As for the other, I shall make
it manifest unto you by easie demonstration.
Let there be gotten a large vessell of glasse, or
other, having besides the mouth another
hole (though but a little one) at the top: poure
water into the vessell by a tunnell thrust into
the mouth of it, and you shall finde that as the
water runneth into the vessell, a winde will
come forth of the little hole, sufficient to blow
out a candle being held over it. This proveth,
that before the water was poured into the vessell
(though to our sight it appeared to bee empty)
it was full of ayre, which forced out of the vessell
as the water ran in; and the reason hereof
is, because the water is by nature of a massie, subtill,
substance; and the ayre of a windy, light, evaporative
nature: The knowledge of this, with
the rarifaction of inclosed ayre, is the ground
and foundation of divers excellent experiments
not unworthy the knowledge of any ingenious
Artist whatsoever.</p>

make a hole in the bottome of the vessell, and put up a

the one end therof may almost touch the top of the great

it will of its owne accord, run and never cease so long as
there is any liquor in the vessell; but if you
fill it below the cane, it will not run at all of

water workes of what sort soeuer, whether for seruice, or

<p class='c005'>A Succur is a box, which is made of brasse (hauing no
bottome) in the middest of which, there is a small bar goeth
crosse, the same hauing a hole in the middle of it; this
box hath a lid so exactly fitted unto it, that being put into
it, no ayre nor water can passe betweene the creuise: this
couer hath a little button on the top, and a seame that goeth
into the box, and so through the hole of the aforesayd
crosse barre, and afterwards it hath a little button riueted
on it, so that it may with ease flip up and downe,

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_8 c005'>Svppose A B C were a deepe Wel, wherein you would
make a Pumpe to draw water to the surface or superficies
of the earth. First therefore you must prouide a pipe
of Lead, or a peece of timber bored through, so long as
will reach unto the bottome of the Well: that part that
standeth in the water must bee cut with two or three
arches, as it were, if it be wood; if Leade, it must haue
somewhat to beare it a little from the bottome, that the
water may thereby bee let into the pipe. Towards the
bottome of the pipe in the water there must bee fastned a
succur; also another of these succurs must be fastned about
two foot aboue the top of the
ground; then haue a bucket
fitted unto the hole of the wood
or leaden pipe; let it bee well
leathered about, and haue a
clacke at the bottome of it, and
let it bee hanged with a sweepe
as the figure sheweth: note that
after you haue filled the distance
betweene the lower succur, and
the bucket with water, that if
you lift up the sweepe, it will
thrust downe the bucket upon
the water, and presse it, the water
being pressed upon by the
bucket, beareth up the clacke,
and comes into the bucket; then
if you pull downe the sweepe,
the clacke shutteth, and so the
water remaynes in the bucket,
which being drawen upward,
there being nothing to follow
but water, both the succurs
open, and there commeth into
the pump so much water as the
buckets drew out.</p>

former mentioned; the pin whereof ought to bee made

about, that by turning of it, you may turne the wheele
also. Then prouide a strong yron chayne of length sufficient,
hauing on euery third or fourth linke a peece of
horne, that will easily goe through the brasse barrell, and
a leather of each side of it, but somewhat broader then
the horne; put this chayne under the lower wheele in
the Well upon both the hollow posts, draw it ouer the

<p class='c005'>Amongst all the experiments pneumaticall, there is
none more excellent than this of the Weather-glasse:
wherefore I haue laboured to describe the making thereof
as plainly as it possibly might be.</p>

<div class="ch">
<i>What the Weather-glasse is.</i>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_8 c005'>A Weather-glasse is a structure of, at the least, two
glasses, sometimes of three, foure, or more, as occasion
serueth, inclosing a quantity of water, and a portion
of ayre proportionable, by whose condensation or rarifaction
the included water is subject unto a continuall
motion, either upward or downward; by which motion
of the water is commonly foreshewn the state, change,
and alteration of the weather. For I speak no more than
what mine experience hath made me bold to affirme;
you may (the time of the yeere, and the following obseruations
understandingly considered) bee able certainly to
foretell the alteration or uncertainty of the weather a
good many houres before it come to passe.</p>

<div class="ch">
<i>Of the severall sorts and fashions of
Weather-glasses.</i>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c005'>There are diuers seuerall fashions of Weather-glasses,
but principally two.</p>

<p class='c005'>1 The Circular glasse.</p>

<p class='c005'>2 The Perpendicular glasse: The Perpendiculars are
either single, double, or treble.</p>

<p class='c005'>The single Perpendiculars are of two sorts, either fixt
or moueable.</p>

<p class='c005'>The fixt are of contrary qualities; either such whose
included water doth moue upward with cold, and downward
with heat, or else upward with heat, and downward
with cold.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the double and treble Perpendiculars, as the water
ascendeth in one, it descendeth as much or more in the other.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the moueable Perpendicular the glasse being artificially
hanged, moueth up and down with the water.</p>

<div class="ch">
<i>How to make the water.</i>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_8 c005'>I must confesse, that any water that is not subiect unto
putrifaction, or freezing, would serue the turne, but Art
hath taught to make such a water as may bee both an ornament
to the work, and also delectable to the eye.</p>

<p class='c005'>Take two ounces of vardigrease in powder, and infuse
it so long in a pint of white wine vineger, untill it hath a
very green colour, then poure out the vineger gently from
the vardigrease: take also a pint and a halfe of purifide
May-dew, and put therein 6 ounces of Roman vitreoll in
grosse powder, let it stand till the vitreoll bee throughly
dissolved; then mix this with the former water, and
strain them through a cap paper, and put it into a cleane
glasse well stopped, and its ready for use.</p>

<div class="ch">
<i>Another.</i>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c005'>Take a gallon of rayn water that hath setled, infuse
therein a day and a night 4 pound of quick lyme; stir
it about with a cleane stick oftentimes in the day; in the
morning poure the cleere water off from the lyme, into a
brasse pan, and adde thereto 3 pound of sal armoniack;
let it stand fiue or six houres, afterwards stir it about untill
it be of a perfect blew colour, then straine it through
a browne paper rowled within a tunnell, and reserue it
for your use. This water is not so good for use as the
former.</p>

<div class="ch">
<i>How to make the Circular glasse.</i>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_8 c005'>First you must prepare two glasses, the fashion whereof
let be like unto the figures marked with the letters A, B,
and C, D. The glasse C, D, is open at both the ends, also
in the middle there is a neck comming up of sufficient
widenesse to receiue the shank end of the glasse marked
with the letters A, B. Then fill the glasse C, D, a third
part, with either of the waters, and diuide the glasse into
so many equall parts as you would haue degrees; rarifie
the ayre in the head of the glasse A, B, by holding it to
the fire, which being yet warme, reuerse the shank of it
into the neck of the glasse C, D. Note that if the water
do not ascend high enough, you must take the glasse A,
B, out againe, and heat it hotter; if it ascend too high,
heat it not so hot. If it be in the dog-dayes, and extreme
heat of summer, 1 and 2 are good degrees; if the weather
be most temperate, then 3 and 4 are best; if a frost, 9 or
10. When you haue hit an indifferent degree, lute the
joynts very close, and fasten a ribben unto the top of the
glasse to hang it by. In this glasse the water will with
cold ascend the glasse A, B, with heat it will descend the
glasse A, B, and ascend the hornes of the glasse C, D.</p>

the change and alteration thereof.</p>

<p class='c005'>1 Note therefore, that the nature and property of the

them that have vents, it descendeth as much as it ascendeth
in these.</p>

into diuers cesterns, out of some wherof there may be
made convayances in their bottoms, by small pipes running
down into the riuer or moat again, and there breaking
out in the fashions and formes of Dragons, Swans,
Whales, Flowers, and such like pretty conceits: out of
others the water may fall upon wheeles, out of whose
spindles, the water turning round, may bee made to run.
In the uppermost story of all, let there bee made the forcer
by ayre, as I taught before, or else a presser, hauing at the
top, Neptune riding on a Whale, out of whose nostrils,
as also out of Neptunes Trident, the water may be made
to spin through small pin-holes; you may also make diuers
motions about this work, but for that the multitude
of figures would rather confound than instruct the Reader,
I haue of purpose omitted them.</p>

<i>Courteous Reader, there hath a desistance
been occasioned since the inception
of this work, by reason of the
occurrence of certaine Authours, that
contrary unto my knowledge had laboured
so fully herein; but after consideration had
(that for the most part they were but translations)
I thought it might bee no lesse lawfull and commendable
for mee than for others, to communicate unto
such as are yet desirous of further information,
that wherein I haue bestowed both cost and paines.
Notwithstanding, I haue so used the matter, as that
I might not derogate from the estimation had of others
to increase mine owne. Read it throughly,
iudge indifferently, and if thou likest it, practise
considerately. If thou art ignorant herein, I am
sure it will instruct thee, and though well experienced
(which perhaps thou art) I make no question,
but that thou mayst finde somewhat which thou hast
not heard of before; So farewell.</i></p>

I haue euer found (in conference with diuers
desirous of instruction in any Art or
Science whatsoeuer) that the summe and
chiefest end of all hath been, to know the
reasons and causes of those things they
were desirous to be informed in. Wherefore
I thought good, before I came to the matter it selfe,
to set down some few Præcognita or Principles (as I may
so call them) whereby such as are ingenious, upon occasion,
may informe themselues, if they stand in doubt of the
cause of any thing that is heereafter taught.</p>

<div class="ch">
<i>Certayne Præcognita or Principles wherein are contayned
the causes and reasons of that which is
taught in this Booke.</i>
</div>

<p class='c005'>1 The foure Elements, Fire, Ayre, Earth, and Water,
are the <i>prima principia</i> (I meane the materialls)
whereof euery sublunary body is composed, and into the
which it is at last dissolued.</p>

<p class='c005'>2 Euery thing finding a dissolution of those <i>naturæ
catenæ</i>, that is, meanes whereby their <i>principia</i> are connected,
and ioyned together, their lighter parts ascend upward,
and these that are more grosse and heauy, doe the
contrary.</p>

<p class='c005'>3 It is impossible for one and the selfe same body to
possesse at one time two places; It followeth therefore,
that a dense body rarified, and made thin, eyther by actuall
or potentiall fire, requireth a greater quantity of room
to be conteyned in, then it did before. Hence it is, that if
you lay your hand upon a glasse, hauing a straight mouth
reuerst into a dish of water, it rarifieth the ayre contayned
therein, and makes it breake out thorough the water in
bubbles. Also, that gunpowder inclosed in the barrell of
a gun, being rarified by fire, applied unto the touch-hole,
it seeketh a greater quantity of roome, and therefore forceth
the bullet out of the barrell. This is called violent
motion.</p>

<p class='c005'>4 According unto the strength and quantity of a
dense body rarified, and according unto the forme and
length of its inclosure, it forceth its compresser further
or neerer at hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus much shall suffice to haue spoken concerning the
<i>Præcognita</i>: Now I will passe <i>ad majora, &amp; ad magis necessaria</i>:
to wit, those necessary Instruments, and seuerall
sorts of Ingredients, that ought to be had in readines.</p>

<p class='c005'>As for the instruments they are these; Morters and
Pestles, Serces, also seuerall sorts of Formers, Paper, Parchment,
Canuas, Whipcord, strong binding thread, Glew,
Rosin, Pitch, with diuers vessells meet to contayne and
mingle your compositions in. The ingredients likewise
are chiefly these, Saltpeter, Rochpeter, Sulpher, Charcoale,
good Gunpowder, Filings of steele, oyle of Peter,
and Spirit of wine.</p>

<div class="ch">
<i>Instructions for chusing your ingredients.</i>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_8 c005'>Saltpeter is very good, if that being layd upon a board,
and fire put to, it rise with a flamed ventosous exhalation,
raysing no scum, nor leauing no pearle, but onely a
blacke specke burnt into the boord.</p>

<p class='c005'>The best brimstone, is quick brimstone, or liue sulphur,
and that sort is best that breaketh whitest; if this cannot
be gotten, take of the whitest yellow brimstone.</p>

<p class='c005'>The best Coales for use are the sallow, willow, hazel
and beech; onely see they be well burnt. Euery of these
ingredients must be powdred finely and searsed.</p>

<p class='c005'>All kindes of gunpowder are made of these ingredients
imposed, or incorporated with vineger, or aquauitæ, and
afterward grayned by art. The Saltpeter is the Soul, the
Sulphur the Life, and the Coales the Body of it. The best
sort of powder may be distinguished from others, by these
signes:</p>

<p class='c005'>1 If it be bright and incline to a blewish colour.</p>

<p class='c005'>2 If in the handling it proue not moyst but auoydeth
quickely.</p>

<p class='c005'>3 If being fired, it flash quickly, and leaue no dregs
nor setlings behinde it.</p>

<div class="ch">
<i>A device to try the strength of divers sorts
of Gunpowder.</i>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id052'>
<img src='images/illustration_066.png' alt='' class='ig052' />
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_8 c005'>If so be you haue at any time diuers sorts of Gunpowder,
and it is your desire to know which of them is the
strongest, then you must prepare a box, as A, B, being
foure inches high, and about two inches wide, hauing a
lid ioynted unto it. The box ought to be made of iron,
brasse, or copper, and to bee fastned unto a good thick
plank, and to haue a touch-hole at the bottom, as O, and
that end of the box where the hinge of the lid is, there
must stand up from the box a peece of iron or brasse, in
length answerable unto the lid of the box: this peece of
iron must haue a hole quite
through it, towards the top,
and a spring, as, A, G, must bee
screwed or riueted, so that the
one end may couer the sayd
hole. On the top of all this iron,
or brasse that standeth up
from the box, there must bee
ioynted a peece of iron (made as
you see in the figure) the hinder
part of which is bent downward,
and entreth the hole that the spring couereth; the
other part resteth upon the lid of the box. Open this
box lid, and put in a quantity of powder, and then shut
the lid down, and put fire to the touch hole at the bottom,
and the powder in the box being fired, will blow
the box lid up the notches more or lesse, according as the
strength of the powder is: so by firing the same quantity
of diuers kindes of powders at seuerall times, you may
know which is the strongest. Now perhaps it will bee
expected that I should speak of the making of Saltpeter,
Gunpowder, Coales, with the refining of Sulphur: but
because they are so commonly to bee had, and to bee
bought at better rates than I know they can bee made by
any that intend it for their priuate use, I haue forborne it:
There are diuers I am sure that would willingly bee in
action: I haue thought fitting therefore to set downe the
collection of naturall Saltpeter, which is a kinde of white
excrescence growing upon stone-wals, and (as I haue
seene great store) in the arches of stone-bridges. First
therefore gather this white excrescence, and adde unto it
Quick-lyme, and Ashes, mingle them, and put them into
a halfe-tub that hath a hole to draw the liquor out at;
then put into this halfe-tub warm water, and let it stand
untill all the peter be dissolued; let it then drain out at
the hole by little and little, and if the liquor be not cleere,
double a brown paper, and put it within a tunnell, and
straine the liquor through it. Then boyle it and scum it
untill it bee ready to congeale, neither too hard, nor yet
too tender: then take it from the fire, and put it into shallow
vessels, either of earth or brasse; set them in a cold
place two or three dayes, and it will shoot into isicles, and
this is called Rochpeter. Thus much for the ingredients.
Now I am come unto the Formers, the number
whereof I cannot certainly determine, because it dependeth
upon the variety of each particular persons inuention.
Now that I may formally proceed, I will first make
some distinction of each kinde in generall; and then I
will speak of euery particular contained in each generall.
Fire-works are of 3 sorts.</p>

<p class='c005'>1 Such as operate in the ayre, as Rockets, Serpents,
Raining fire, Stars, Petards, Dragons, Fire-drakes, Feinds,
Gyronels, or Fire-wheeles, Balloons.</p>

<p class='c005'>2 Such as operate upon the earth, as Crackers, Trunks,
Lanterns, Lights, Tumbling bals, Saucissons, Towers,
Castles, Pyramids, Clubs, Lances, Targets.</p>

<p class='c005'>3 Such as burn in or on the water, as Rockets, Dolphins,
Ships, Tumbling bals.</p>

<p class='c005'>Part of either of the three kindes are simple, and part
are compounded; part also are fixed, and part moueable.
First I will treat of the diuers compositions, and then of
the Formers, Coffins, and manner of composing euery of
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next figure marked with M, N, doeth expresse
both the parts of the Former pinned together; unto this
Former there must be made one Rowler expressed by the
figure A; also two rammers expressed by the figures G
H; they must all of them be turned very even and smooth;
let the diameter of the thicknesse of the rowler expressed

hole bored in the very midst of the end, so wide and so
deep, that all the broach of the former may enter the
same: this is to rowle the coffin of paper and upon.
The first rammer noted with the figure G, must bee
seuen inches and a halfe long, from 3 to 4, and haue a
hole at the end of it, as the rowler had; this rammer is
to ram the composition into the former (hauing the coffin
in it) untill it bee raysed aboue the broach. The second
rammer noted with the figure H, must be fiue inches and
three quarter long from 5 to 6, and it must haue no hole
at the top as the other had; it serueth to ram the composition
into the coffin, when it is once raysed aboue the
broach. The diameter of the thicknesse of these two
rammers must be a thought lesse than the diameter of the
rowler, to the end they may not hurt the coffin, being driuen
in. Now to make the coffins you must take paper,
parchment, or strong canuasse, rowle it hard upon the
rowler, so often untill it will go stiffe into the body of the
Former: then thrust it rowler and all through the sayd
hollow body of the Former; put then the broach of the
formers breech into the hole of the rowler, and with a
peece of strong packthred choake the coffin within halfe
an inch of the rowlers end (which you may do best, and
with most ease, if you first dip the end of the coffin into
fayre water, so that it may be wet quite through) after you
haue choaked the coffin, you must thrust the breech of
the former, the coffin also with the rowler in it, up into
the body of the former: then pin the breech fast to the
body of the former with the pin, and on the rowler
giue one stroak or two with a mallet lightly, then unpin
the breech, and with the rowler thrust the coffin out of
the bottom of the former, lay it by untill the end be dry.
Thus you may at leisure times make diuers coffins ready

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c005'>The diameter of hollownesse of the mould for Rockets
that swim on the water, must be one inch, and eight
inches long: let the breech enter into the body of the
Rocket one inch, and it must have no broach at all in it.
Let the diameter of the thicknesse of the rowler bee three
quarters of an inch, the rammer must be a thought lesser;
then ram it full of the composition of Rockets for the
water; joyne to the upper end of it a Saucisson: then couer
it all over with melted pitch, rosin, wax, or tallow, to
the end that the water may not spoyle the coffins; and to
make it float along the water, binde a rod about two foot
long, as you did unto the rockets for the ayre: now if you
would have the rocket to change his actions, (that is, to
swim one while above the water, and one while under
the water) then put into it in the filling, one spoonfull
of composition, and ram that in; then one spoonfull
of whole powder, and ram that in; and then another of

coffins of the rockets; then hang a stone at the bottom
of the stick that hath the hole in it, to make it sink down
into the water; then fire the water rocket, and cast them

The Art of <i>Drawing</i> is in it selfe most
excellent, and most worthy commendations
in whosoever it is; yea
it is an Art so necessarie unto all ingenious
Artists, as that in no wise
they can be without it, and my selfe
haue found it to bee true, that the
sight of a good draught is more unto an ingenious person,
then a whole Chaptor of Information; Wherefore
I have, according unto my knowledge and practise therein,
faithfully penned the same; for the use of all such as
beare affection unto the Art, and are desirous to be instructed
therein: And for that divers persons cannot attaine
unto it, or perhaps are loath to bestow any time to
practise it: whereby they might come to a requisite perfection:
for such I have set downe certaine directions,
and those so facile, and easie; that persons altogether unskilfull,
may (having a patterne) worke very well; But
before I begin, it behooveth that I prescribe what things
are to be had in readinesse to worke withall: first therefore
provide good smooth and cleare paper, divers plummets
made of blacke leade, oker, or blacke chalke, or else
Charcoals made of Ash, Sallow, or Beech, split in sunder,
and pointed; also a wing: having provided these your
implements, you shall thus begin to worke. First, let the
thing, whose pourtrature you intend to take, stand before
you, so that the light be not hindred from falling upon
it, and with a pointed peece of charcoale draw it rustically;
which when you have done, consider a while whether
all the parts thereof are proportionable, and whether
it carry the semblance of the thing that you drew it from,
which if it do not, wipe it out with your wing, and begin
anew: but if it be faulty in one part onely, wipe onely
that part out, and draw it againe; whensoever it liketh
you, or that you have so drawne it, that you can finde no
great fault in it: wipe it over gently with your wing, so
that you may perceive the former strokes: then with your
blacke chalke, or blacke lead plummets; draw it as perfectly,
and as curiously as you can, and shadow it according
as the light falleth upon it; This way is workeman
like, and the most difficult of all, yet by a little practice
may easily be attained unto: so that the persons stand well
affected unto the Art. Instead of white paper, you may
take light coloured blew paper, and draw upon it with
charcoale, and white chalke pointed, which will shew very
wel: but note, that after you have made your draught,
you must wet it in faire water, and let it dry of it selfe; this
will make the drawing to hold fast on, which would
otherwise easily be wiped off. This may serve for such as
are contented to take some paines to attaine so noble a
Science. But for others there are divers other helps, which
follow in order.</p>

<div class="ch">
<i>How to take the perfect draught of any printed, or
painted Picture.</i>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c005'>Take a sheete of Venice (or in stead thereof) of the
finest white paper that you can get: wet it all ouer
with cleane sallet oyle: then wipe the oyle off from
the paper, as cleane as you can, so that the paper may be
dry, otherwise it will spoyle a printed picture by the soaking
through of the oyle: hauing thus prepared your paper,
lay it upon any painted or printed picture, and you
shall see the picture through the same more perfectly appearing,
then through glasse, and so with a blacke lead
pen, you may draw it ouer with ease, and better first with
a soft char-cole, and then with a pen. After that you haue
thus drawne the picture upon the oyled paper, put it upon
a sheete of cleane white paper, and with a little sticke
pointed, or (which is better) with a feather taken out of
a Swallowes wing: draw ouer the picture againe, and so
you shall haue the same very prettily and neatly drawne
upon the white paper, which you may set out with colours,
as shall be taught hereafter.</p>

<div class="ch">
<i>Another way.</i>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_8 c005'>Having drawne the picture, first open the oyled paper,
put it upon a sheete of cleane white paper, and
pricke ouer the same drawing, with a good big pin, then
from the cleane sheete, that is pricked, pounce it upon
another: that is, take some small coale, powder it fine, and
wrap it in a piece of Tiffanie or such like, and binde it up
therein loosely, and clap it lightly ouer all the pricked
lines by little and little, and afterwards draw it ouer again
with a Pen or Pencill, or otherwise as you please.</p>

<div class="ch">
<i>Another way very pretty and easie to be performed.</i>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c005'>Take some Lake, and grinde it fine, and temper it with
Linseed oyle, and afterwards with a pen, draw with
this mixture (in stead of Inke) all the out stroaks of any
printed picture, also the muscles: then wet the contrary
side of the picture, and presse it hard upon a sheete of
cleane white paper, and it will leaue behinde it all the
stroakes of the said picture that you draw ouer.</p>

<div class="ch">
<i>Another way much like the former.</i>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c005'>Take Printers Blacking, grinde it fine, and temper it
with faire water, and with a pen dipt therein, draw
ouer the master stroakes and out lines of the muscles: wet
then a faire paper with a spunge, and clap the picture upon
it, pressing it very hard thereupon, and you shall finde
the stroakes you drew, left upon the faire paper.</p>

<div class="ch">
<i>An easie way to lessen any picture: that is, to draw
a picture from another, in a lesser compasse.</i>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id081'>
<img src='images/illustration_117.png' alt='' class='ig081' />
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_8 c005'>First, with a ruler, and a blacke lead plummet, draw a
line at the very top: also another at the bottome paralell,
or equally distant from the other: from the upper
line, let fall two perpendicular or plum-lines euen unto
the lowermost line, so those foure lines will make a
square: now you must diuide this square into diuers equall
parts, with a paire of compasses, and draw lines with a
ruler and blacke lead plummet, quite over the picture: so
the lesselines will divide the picture into equall parts or
squares: then take a faire paper, and make as many squares
upon it, as there is in the picture: you may make them as
little as you will, but be sure that they are equall, and of
just number with those in the picture. Having thus crossed
your picture, and drawne over your faire paper into
squares, take a blacke lead pen, and draw the picture by
little and little, passing from square unto square, untill you
have finished the whole: still observing the order of the
squares as they stand in either: then draw it ouer with a
pen, in which second drawing of it over, you may easily
mend any fault: when it is dry, rub it over with the crum
of white bread, and it will take off all the blacke lead
strokes, and your draught onely will remaine faire upon
the paper or parchment. Here I might have entred into
discourse of drawing paralels, perpendiculars, making of
squares, and such like: but to deal truely, I was as loth to
trouble my selfe, as to wearie you: you shall neede onely
to provide a ruler of thin brasse or copper, having a crosse
thwart one end of it: the charge will not be much, nor the
use tedious: the figure followeth, noted A, B.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id082'>

</div>
<div  class='figcenter id083'>
<img src='images/illustration_118_b.png' alt='' class='ig083' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>Let <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, be a line given, whereon to erect a perpendicular
or plumb line: lay the ruler so, that the crosse
over the end of it, may lye full upon the Line, then draw
a Line by the side of the rule, and it is done.</p>

<div class="ch">
<i>A verie easie way, to describe a Towne, or Castle:
being within the full sight thereof.</i>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_8 c005'>For the effecting of this, you must have a frame made,
and crossed into equall squares with Lute strings, and
figured at the end of each string: this frame must have a
foot, wherein it must be made to be lifted higher or lower
as occasion serveth; also you must divide your paper that
you are to draw upon into so many equal squares as your
frame containeth: having the like figures at the ends of
each line that there is on the frame; before this frame
must be placed a style or bodkin having a little glasse on
the top of it for to direct the sight. Note now that the
nearer any thing commeth unto the Center, the lesser it
appeareth: hence it is that a Towne of a mile, or more
long, or a huge great Castle, at a distance may be comprehended,
and that easily within the limits of so small a
frame; By the stile direct your sight from one part to another,
beginning at one square, and proceeding through
the rest in order as they lie; Marke well the following
figure.</p>

<div class="ch">
<i>How to make a Deske: by meanes whereof you may
draw, and that most exactly with great facilitie
any printed picture, or sollid Image.</i>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_8 c005'>First let there be a frame made, and with hinges let be
joynted unto a board of equall breadth unto it: let
this frame also have two stayes at the top, at each end
one, by meanes whereof the deske may be raised higher,
or lower, as need shall require; then fasten to the frame
a peece of pure cleare glasse fitted thereunto, and it is finished.

<div class='ic085'>
<p><i>The Deske.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The manner of using this Deske is thus. If the picture
that you intend to draw be a printed one, then first fasten
it next unto the Deske with waxe, paste, or such like: upon
it fasten a sheet of faire paper: If it be in the day-time
place the backe of it towards the Sunne; if it be in the
night that you worke, place a lampe behinde it, and so
you shall see perfectly every (even the least) stroake of
the picture, which with your penne you may draw as
acurately as any Limmer whatsoever. If it be a solid
peece, then place it behinde the Deske, betweene the light
and the Deske: then fasten a sheet of cleane white paper
upon the Deske; raise then the Deske higher, or lower
untill you see the perfect shadow of the image through
your Deske, and paper, and then draw the posture of the
Image, and shadow it afterwards (without the Deske) as
light falleth upon it.</p>

<div class="ch">
<i>An easie way to take the naturall, and lively shape
of the leafe of any hearbe or tree, which thing passeth
the Art of man to imitate with Pen or Pensill.</i>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_8 c005'>First take the leafe that you would have, and gently
bruise the ribs and veines on the backe side of it, afterwards
wet that side with Linseed-oyle, and then presse
it hard upon a peece of cleane white paper, and so you
shall have the perfect figure of the said leafe, with every
veine thereof, so exactly exprest as being lively coloured,
it would seeme to bee truly naturall, by this we learne,
that Nature being but a little adjuvated or seconded
with Art, can worke wonders.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now for the farther information of such as are desirous
of exemplarie instruction, I have set downe in order following
the delineation of the proportion of such things
as in my judgement seemed most necessarie for young beginners,
and those in such easie demonstrations as for the
most part they consist of equall squares, and require no
more for their right understanding, then diligent observation,
I might have filled a whole Booke of such like:
but having considered that what I had done, was a sufficient
ground for a farther procession, I thought fitting to
leave each person to the exercise and practice of his best
Invention.</p>

The principall end and subject of this Art,
is to set out things both in proportion of
parts, and livelinesse of colour.</p>

<p class='c005'>For the former, the proportion of parts,
I have given sufficient information for the
meanest capacitie in the precedent part of this tractat:
now therefore I will speake of the other, the colouring or
setting out in colours. But first provide a frame or Easel
called by Artists, which is very necessary to worke upon,
especially in greater pieces of worke: the forme whereof
followeth.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id094'>

<div class='ic094'>
<p><i>The Easel.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Also you must provide divers little shels to put your
colours in, also pensils of all sorts, both for priming and
other: a light ruler of one foot and a halfe, or two foot
long: and colours of all sorts ground very fine upon a
porphire or marble. Having provided these, you shall set
to worke, observing the subsequent directions.</p>

<p class='c005'>Painting may be performed either with water colours,
or with oyle colours.</p>

<p class='c005'>First I will speake of water colours, wherein I shall observe
two things.</p>

<p class='c005'>First, the diversitie of colours, and preparations. Secondly,
their mixture, and manner of laying them on the
ground.</p>

<p class='c005'>First of the first, the diversitie of colours and their preparation.</p>

<p class='c005'>Colours are either simple or compounded, meerely
tinctures of vegetables, or substances of minerals, or both:
the simple colours are such as of themselves, being tempered
with the water or oyle, doe give a colour. The compounded
are such, whose ingredients do exceed the number
of one. Vegetables are rootes, juces, berries, and such
like things as grow out of the earth. Minerals are such as
are dig'd out of the earth, as earth, and stones, &amp;c. All
which follow in order, as well their preparations, as description.
First note that every colour to be ground, ought

<p class='c005'>Now I am come to the second thing observable (to

which is thus: your colours prepared for use, ought to be
tempered according unto direction, still observing a
meane: and to that end, mixe them by little and little, till
the colour please you; first you must lay on the ground
colour, and let it dry throughly: then with a small pensill,
pricke on the second colour, else it will be apt to run
abroad, nor can you worke it so well, to make it seeme
liuely, as you may by pricking it one, specially in small
peeces.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you are to paint ouer maps, or printed pictures that
haue writing in them, they use to lay on the thinnest colours,
and alwaies before you lay any colours upon paper,
wet the backe side of it with faire water, wherein
store of Allum hath been dissolued, and let it dry of it
selfe: after wet it againe, and let it dry: doe it the third
time, for this will strengthen the paper, that the colour
shall not sinke through it, and moreouer it will make the
colour shew the brighter, and last, the better.</p>

varnish on siluer, then take the white that is found in
Bengewine and dresse it with <i>Aqua vitæ</i> as afore, leauing
out the Saffron, and the said vernish made with these
onely is very good to varnish all things as well painted,
as not painted: for it maketh Tables of Walnut tree and
Hebene to glister if it bee laid on them; and all other

a little Saffron, put not too much water; mingle it after
discretion, and looke the size be thicke standing: put the
size thus tempered, in a horne or shell in some Celler, or
shadowed place, where it may stand moyst seven dayes,
till it be perfect clammy and rotten, and once a day stirre
it; the elder the size is, it is the better. If there stand any
bubbles on the size, put in eare waxe, for that is a remedy
thereto, and before you lay it on your worke, lay the size
on a scrow, and dry it, and when it is dry, bend it, and if
it bend and breake not, then it is perfect, and if it breake,
put to it a little water to make it weaker, and proue if it

greene Bise, Verdigrease, and a multitude of such like,
which may be had at the Rose in <i>Cornehill, London</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Your colours must be ground all very finely, and tempered
with Linseed oyle; and to preserve them, put them
in little earthen pans, and put water upon them, and cover
them, that the dust come not at them: thus they may
be kept a great while, and from thence you may take
them as your use doth require.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are divers colours which without the admixture
of another colour, will not be dry a great while; as Lake,
Verdigrease, Lam-blacke: with such you must temper a
little Vmber or red lead.</p>

<p class='c005'>Divers Painters there are, that having haste of worke,
doe use to temper their colour with one part of fatte oyle,
and two of common Linseed oyle, and by this meanes
they make the colours dry the sooner: this fat oyle is onely
Linseed oyle exposed to the weather, and so it becommeth
thicker: yea sometimes you shall see it so thicke,
that you may cut it almost like Butter: it may bee made
likewise by boyling of it a little while, but the former is
the best. As for the tempering of your colours, I can prescribe
no surer way then experience with diligent observation.</p>

It is possible for one to be a good Painter,
and yet not to be able to draw well with
the pen, because there is not required in a
Painter such a curious and exact carriage
of the hand: but it is impossible for one
ever to Grave or Etch well, except he can draw well with
the pen. First therefore presupposing you can doe the
first before you attempt the second, you must provide divers
graving tooles, both long and short: some for hard
worke, some for sweet worke, some for smaller worke, and
some for greater: also a peece of a Beaver hat, and a good
oyle stone, smoothed on one side, and free from pin holes,
and plates of Copper or Brasse exactly polished.</p>

<div class="ch">
<i>Of Gravers.</i>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c005'>There are two principall sorts of Gravers, the long
and the short: the long are straight, and for to engrave
Plates withall, especially the greater, and
these are to be held as the figure following doth expresse:
where you may note that the pummell of the Graver
resteth against the ball of the thumb, and the point is
guided with the forefinger. And there ought to bee a
little bagge of sand under your Plate, to the end that
you might turne your plate upon it as your worke doth
require.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id097'>
<img src='images/illustration_154.png' alt='' class='ig097' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>The second sort is a short Graver, and turneth up
somewhat at the end, and that is to engrave Letters and
Scutchions in plate seales, and smaller plates, being
fastened in some convenient instrument: this must be held
likewise according unto the expression of the figure following:
where it is to be noted, that the pummell of the
Graver is stayed against the further part of the hand, and
is guided by the inward side of the thumbe. It were needfull
that there were a piece of leather like a Taylors thimble,
about the end of the thumbe, waxed or glued, whereby
to guide the Graver more steadily, and stay it upon
occasion.</p>

<i>How to make Gravers.</i>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_8 c005'>Provide some good crosse-bow steele, and cause it to
be beaten out into small rods, and softned: then with
a good file you may shape them at your pleasure:
when you have done, heat them red hot, and dip them
straight downe into sope, and by so doing, they will bee
hard indeed. Note that if in the dipping of them into
the sope, you turne your hand never so little awry, the
Graver will be crooked. These Gravers made and hardened
after this manner, doe farre exceed all the other
Gravers.</p>

<p class='c005'>If your gravers be too hard, heate them a little, and
thrust them into tallow, and they will be tougher.</p>

<p class='c005'>The oyle stone is to whet your gravers on; drop one or
two drops of sallet oyle upon it, and whet your graver
thereon, and it will have an edge presently.</p>

<div class="ch">
<i>How to smooth and pollish Copper Plates.</i>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_8 c005'>Because that in the printing with Copper Plates, the
least scratch, though it be scarce visible, receiveth its
impression, and so many times disgraceth the worke: I
have set downe a way to smooth plates for impression.</p>

<p class='c005'>First, take a piece of Brasse, or Copper, of what bignesse
you intend, of an indifferent thicknesse, and see as
neere as you can, that it bee free from fire flawes. First
beat it as smooth as you can with a hammer, then rub it
smooth with a pumice stone that is void of gravell, (least it
race it, &amp; so cause you as much more labour to get them out)
burnish it after with a burnishing iron, having first dropped
a drop or two of sallet oyle on it: then rub it over
with a cole, prepared as is after taught, and lastly with a
peece of beaver hat dipt in sallet oyle, rub it very well for
an houre: thus you may polish it exactly.</p>

<div class="ch">
<i>How to prepare your Coales.</i>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c005'>Take Beechen charcole, such as when they are broke,
doe shine, such as are void of clifts, and such as
breake off even: burne them againe, and as soone as
they are all through on fire, quench them in chamber lye:
after take them out, and put them in faire water, and reserue
them for your use.</p>

<i>Of Etching.</i>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_8 c005'>Etching is an imitation of engrauing, but more speedily
performed. Things may be expressed to the life
thereby, but not so sweetly as by the Graver. It is
thus performed: the Plate you are to etch upon, must
first exactly be pollished, afterwards ouerlaid but very
lightly with a ground made for the purpose, (of which
anon) and thereupon must be pounced, drawne, or traced,
the thing that you are to etch: then the said ground
is to be pierced with diuers stiles of seuerall bignesse according
as the shadowes of the picture doe require: afterwards
the edges of the Plate are to be raised with soft
waxe and strong water, (for so they terme it:) (It is to
be had at the signe of the Legge in <i>Foster Lane</i> a Distiller)
is to be put upon it, which in those places were the
strokes, are required to be lightly performed, is to be abated
or alayed with faire water, which hauing dured a
while upon the plate, will eate into it, as it were engraven,
then put it into cold water, and wash it about, and it will
leaue eating further, and then take off the ground and it
is done.</p>

<i>How to sodder upon Silver, Brasse, or Iron.</i>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c005'>There are two kindes of Sodder, to wit, hard Sodder,
and soft Sodder. The soft Sodder runneth sooner then
the hard: wherefore if a thing be to be sodered in two
places, which cannot at one time well be performed, then
the first must be sodered with hard soder, and the second
with soft: for if the first be done with soft, it will unsoder
againe before the other be sodered. Note, that if you
would not have your soder to runne over any one part of
the peece to be sodered, you must rub over that part with
chalke that you would not have it runne upon.</p>

<p class='c005'>Note likewise that your soder must be beaten thinne,
and then laid over the place to be sodered, which must be
first fitted together, and bound with wyer as occasion
shall require. Then take Burras, powder it, and temper it
with water like pap, and lay it upon the soder, and let it
drie upon it by the fire: Afterwards cover it with quicke
coals, and blow them up, and you shall see your soder run
immediately: then presently take it out of the fire, and it
is done.</p>

<i>How to gild Silver, or Brasse, with water-gold.</i>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_8 c005'>First take about ℥. ii. of quicke silver, put it into a little

take it off presently for the gold will presently be dissolved
in the quicke silver, which if it be too thinne, you may
through a peece of fustian straine a part of the quicke-silver
from it. Note likewise that your silver, or brasse, before
you go about to gild it, must be boyled in argol, and
beare, or water, and afterwards scratcht with a wyer
brush: then rub the gold, and quicke-silver upon it, and
it will cleave unto it, then put your siluer or brasse upon
quicke coales untill it begin to smoke: then take it from
the fire, and scratch it with your wyer brush: Do this so
often till you have rubd the quicke-silver as cleane off as
you can, then shall you perceive the gold to appeare of a
faint yellow colour, which you may make to shew faire
with sal armoniacke, bole armoniacke, and vardigrece
